1. "config.py": This file will contain shared configuration variables such as API keys, base URLs for dextools and dexscreener, and other global settings.

2. "Token" data schema: Defined in "models/token.py", this schema will be used across "bot.py", "volume_checker.py", "snipping_service.py", and the test files to represent and manipulate token data.

3. "DextoolsAPI" and "DexscreenerAPI": These classes defined in "api/dextools.py" and "api/dexscreener.py" respectively, will be used in "bot.py", "volume_checker.py", "snipping_service.py", and the test files to interact with the respective APIs.

4. "VolumeChecker" and "SnippingService": These services defined in "services/volume_checker.py" and "services/snipping_service.py" will be used in "bot.py" and the test files to check token volumes and perform snipping operations.

5. Function names: Functions such as "get_tokens_with_growing_volume", "snip_token", "run_bot", etc. will be shared across multiple files. These functions will be defined in the service files and used in "bot.py" and the test files.

6. Message names: Certain message names like "TOKEN_SNIPPED", "VOLUME_GROWTH_DETECTED", etc. might be used across "bot.py", the service files, and the test files for logging or communication purposes.

7. Test case names: Test case names like "test_get_tokens_with_growing_volume", "test_snip_token", etc. will be shared across the test files.

8. "main.py": This file will use the "run_bot" function from "bot.py" and possibly some configuration variables from "config.py".
